D'oh - Directories over Http

Curl is great, it's probably what you want. There is a wee tiny chance though that you don't like the interface it offers, all the ugly html. Let's say you used [http](https://github.com/thecoshman/http) (not [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) and are hosting a folder that you can view in a browser, but want to view that folder from a command line, say hello to D'Oh! It'll provide Directories Over HTTP.

This might be like an FTP style interface... or it could maybe do some sort of mounted folder thing... or something else... what ever it does, it'll probably be aimed at the server side being http (the program, not the protocol, well also the protocol, but specifaclly the program)

ps, totes serious
